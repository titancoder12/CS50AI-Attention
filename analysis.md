## Layer 1, Head 11

This attention head seems to show how the AI is paying attention to the role the adjectives play in the sentence. When I gave the input of 'I ate a [MASK] red apple, the attention of [MASK] focused on the noun 'apple' and the adjective 'red'. When I gave the input of 'I built a [MASK] car', even more attention was placed on the noun 'car'. 

Example Sentences:
- I ate a [MASK] red apple.
- I built a [MASK] car.

## Layer 6, Head 7

This attention head seems to be showing how the AI is paying attention to the role of prepositions in a sentence. When I gave the input of 'I walked across the [MASK].', the attention of 'across' was really focusing on the verb 'walked'. When I gave the input of 'I climbed above the [MASK]', it also really focused on the verb 'climbed'. 

Example Sentences:
- I walked across the [MASK].
- I climbed above the [MASK].
